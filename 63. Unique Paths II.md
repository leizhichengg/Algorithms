# 63. Unique Paths II

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Solution

### 1. Dynamic Programming

> If there is anobstacle, set to be 0.

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        if (obstacleGrid.length == 0 || obstacleGrid[0][0] == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        obstacleGrid[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < obstacleGrid.length; i++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0) {
                obstacleGrid[i][0] = obstacleGrid[i-1][0];
            } else if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1) {
                obstacleGrid[i][0] = 0;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < obstacleGrid[0].length; i++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][i] == 0) {
                obstacleGrid[0][i] = obstacleGrid[0][i-1];
            } else if (obstacleGrid[0][i] == 1) {
                obstacleGrid[0][i] = 0;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < obstacleGrid.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < obstacleGrid[0].length; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0) {
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = obstacleGrid[i][j - 1] + obstacleGrid[i - 1][j];
                } else if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 1) {
                    obstacleGrid[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return obstacleGrid[obstacleGrid.length - 1][obstacleGrid[0].length - 1];
    }
}
```
