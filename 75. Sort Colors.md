# 75. Sort Colors

Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

**Example:**

```
Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]
```

**Follow up:**

- A rather straight forward solution is a two-pass algorithm using counting sort.
  First, iterate the array counting number of 0's, 1's, and 2's, then overwrite array with total number of 0's, then 1's and followed by 2's.
- Could you come up with a one-pass algorithm using only constant space?

## Solution

### 1. Straight forward

```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int zero_count = 0;
        int one_count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                zero_count++;
            } else if (num == 1) {
                one_count++;
            }
        }
        int i = 0;
        for (; i < zero_count; i++) {
            nums[i] = 0;
        }
        for (; i < zero_count + one_count; i++) {
            nums[i] = 1;
        }
        for (; i < nums.length; i++) {
            nums[i] = 2;
        }
    }
}
```

**Runtime:** 0ms

**Time complexity:** *O*(n)

**Space complexity:** *O*(1)

### 2. One-pass

> Sign the start point of one and two, and just change the start point after access each number.

```java
class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        int one_start = 0;
        int two_start = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            switch (nums[i]) {
                case 0:
                    nums[i] = 2;
                    nums[two_start++] = 1;
                    nums[one_start++] = 0;
                    break;
                case 1:
                    nums[i] = 2;
                    nums[two_start++] = 1;
                    break;
                case 2:
                    nums[i] = 2;
                    break;
                default:
            }
        }
    }
}
```
