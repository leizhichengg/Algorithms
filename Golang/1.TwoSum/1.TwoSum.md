# 1. TwoSum

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have ***exactly\*** one solution, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].
```

# Solution

## 1. Brute Force
The Brute Force approach is simple, just use two loops, 
first index "i" from 0 to nums' length minus 1, 
and the second index "j" from "i" plus 1 to nums' 
length, if nums[i] plus nums[j] not equal to target, 
continue the loop, otherwise, get the answer.
This approach's time complexity is O(n^2), 
space complexity is O(1)

## 2. Map
This approach use a map, save all nums to a map, 
num as the key, index as the value, then use a loop, 
for each element, check if there is the value equal 
to target minus element in the map,  if exist and 
not the same element, get the answer, otherwise, 
continue the loop.
This approach's time complexity is O(n),
space complexity is O(n).
