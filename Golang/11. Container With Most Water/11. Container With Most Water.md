# 11. Container With Most Water

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

# Solution

The area of water decided by the shortest line.

So, at first, we set first and last line as the 
sides of container, get the water area, then we move 
those two lines together step by step.

Set i and j as the index of first and last lines.
if `height[i] < height[j]`, get the water's area, 
so the height of water is `height[i]`, the width 
of water is `j-i`, if only j move step by step to left, 
`j-i` decrease, the height of water must less than or equal to 
`height[i]`, the area of water must less and less, 
so we can ignore these cases. If `height[i] > height[j]`, 
is same situation.

So if `height[i] < height[j]`, make i plus 1, 
if `height[i] > height[j]`, make j minus 1, 
then compare `height[i]` and `height[j]` again.
Until i not less than j, get the max area of water.
