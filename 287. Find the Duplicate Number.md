# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array _nums_ containing _n_ + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and _n_ (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,3,4,2,2]

**Output:** 2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [3,1,3,4,2]

**Output:** 3

**Note:**

1.  You **must not** modify the array (assume the array is read only).
2.  You must use only constant, _O_(1) extra space.
3.  Your runtime complexity should be less than _O_(n^2).
4.  There is only one duplicate number in the array, but it could be repeated more than once.

## Solution

### 1. Sort

```java
class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length-1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i+1])
                return nums[i];
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

**Runtime:**  4ms
**Time complexity:** _O_(nlogn)
**Space complexity:** _O_(n)
