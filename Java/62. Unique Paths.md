# 62. Unique Paths

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

Above is a 7 x 3 grid. How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

## Solution

### 1. Dynamic Programming

```java
class Solution {
    public int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        if (m == 0 || n == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        Integer[][] map = new Integer[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            map[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            map[0][i] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                map[i][j] = map[i][j - 1] + map[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
        return map[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```
