# 319. Bulb Switcher

There are *n* bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs. Then, you turn off every second bulb. On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the *i*-th round, you toggle every *i*bulb. For the *n*-th round, you only toggle the last bulb. Find how many bulbs are on after *n* rounds.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 1 
Explanation: 
At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
After first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
After second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
After third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 

So you should return 1, because there is only one bulb is on.
```

### 1. Math

> 灯泡开关被转换次数为奇数时，灯泡最终状态为关
>
> 灯泡i只有在i能够被i小的数整除时转换，例如灯泡6能够被2、3还有6整除，所以切换了3次，最终为关
>
> 要想灯泡转换次数为偶数，则灯泡i必须是整数的平方，例如灯泡4，2的平方，被2和4整除，切换了两次，最终为开
>
> 所以答案就是灯泡数n以内有多少平方数，包括1
