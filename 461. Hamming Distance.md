# 461. Hamming Distance

The [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers `x` and `y`, calculate the Hamming distance.

**Note:**
0 ≤ `x`, `y` < 231.

**Example:**

```
Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

## Solution

### 1.  Bit manipulation

> Hamming Distance is the counts of one in x ^ y. 

```java
class Solution {
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
        int res = x ^ y;
        int count = 0;
        while (res != 0) {
            count += (res & 1);
            res >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
