# 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower

We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from **1** to **n**. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API `guess(int num)` which returns 3 possible results (`-1`, `1`, or `0`):

```
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
```

**Example :**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

```java
/* The guess API is defined in the parent class GuessGame.
   @param num, your guess
   @return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
      int guess(int num); */

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while(left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int ans = guess(mid);
            if (ans == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (ans == 1) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

- **Use `mid = left + (right - left) / 2 ` instead of  `mid = (left + right) / 2`**
