# 260. Single Number III

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**

```
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

**Note**:

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

## Solution

### 1.  Bit manipulation

> Step1: 首先对数组中所有元素进行异或操作，得到两个目标数的异或值
>
> Step2: 找出两个目标数的区别，即找出异或值中1所在的最低位，表示两个目标数该位不同
>
> Step3: 重新遍历数组异或得到两个目标数
>
> `diff & -diff` will get the lowest one bit.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int[] ans = {0, 0};
        int diff = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            diff ^= num;
        }
        diff &= -diff;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if ((num & diff) == 0) {
                ans[0] ^= num;
            } else {
                ans[1] ^= num;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
