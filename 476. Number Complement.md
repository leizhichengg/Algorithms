# 476. Number Complement

Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

**Note:**

1. The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
2. You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
```

## Solution

### 1.  Bit manipulation

> Use num ^ 1111...
>
> 1的个数等于num中1所在的最高位索引数

```java
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        int temp = num;
        int idex = -1;
        while (temp != 0) {
            temp >>= 1;
            idex++;
        }
        temp = (1 << (idex + 1)) - 1;
        int ans = num ^ temp;
        return ans;
    }
}
```
